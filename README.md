# B-Tech_Major_Project
This Arduino-based project demonstrates how to control an RGB LED to generate a wide range of lighting effects using basic electronics and C++ programming. It simulates effects like color gradients, breathing, strobe, chasing, rainbow, and even user-defined colors through serial input.
