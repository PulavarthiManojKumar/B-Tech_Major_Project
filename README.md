# Creating Multi-Colored Light Using Arduino UNO

This project uses an Arduino UNO and a Common Anode RGB LED to produce a variety of lighting effects through PWM control. The program simulates real-world lighting scenarios including color fading, breathing lights, rainbow transitions, and interactive user input via the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Color Gradient Effect (Smooth transitions across spectrum)
- Breathing Effect (Slow pulse-like fading)
- Strobe Light Effect (Quick on/off flashes)
- Chasing RGB Effect (R-G-B loop effect)
- Rainbow Color Loop
- Disco Mode (Rapid color changes)
- Fire Flicker Simulation
- User-defined RGB color entry via Serial

## ðŸ§° Components Used

- Arduino UNO
- Common Anode RGB LED
- Resistors (220 ohm)
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- USB Cable (for Arduino)

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Connect the Common Anode RGB LED as per schematic:
   - RED â†’ PWM Pin (e.g., 9)
   - GREEN â†’ PWM Pin (e.g., 10)
   - BLUE â†’ PWM Pin (e.g., 11)
   - Common Anode â†’ 5V

2. Upload the sketch: `sketch_apr8a.ino` using Arduino IDE

3. Open **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud) and enter numbers to switch between effects:
1 â†’ Color Gradient
2 â†’ Breathing
3 â†’ Strobe
4 â†’ Chasing RGB
5 â†’ Rainbow
6 â†’ Disco
7 â†’ Fire Flicker
8 â†’ Enter Custom Color (R G B)

4. For Custom Mode, input 3 values between 0â€“255 separated by space.
Example: 255 100 50
